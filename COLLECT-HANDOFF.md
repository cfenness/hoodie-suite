# Hoodie Collect — handoff

State as of 2026-07-29, end of a long session on the UberEats pull. Written so the next person (or
session) starts from evidence rather than from this conversation. Everything below is measured unless
it says otherwise.

---

## 1. Where the UberEats pull actually is

| | |
|---|---|
| Goal | one full pull of 502,212 stores in **under 3 hours** = **46.5 stores/sec** sustained |
| Best measured | **12 stores/s** sustained at 90%+ usable (controller was throttling itself) |
| Burst measured | **70 stores/s** at 98.8% usable, held ~60s |
| Right now | **51% usable** under fleet load on `safari17_0` |
| Captured | ~33k of 502,212 (6.5%) |

**The goal was not met and is not close on current evidence.** But nothing structural blocks it: at
46.5/s the fleet asks only ~2.3 req/s per exit IP and ~0.9 session primes/s, neither aggressive.

### The open problem, stated precisely

`impersonate="safari17_0"` returns **4/4 usable** on a single sequential probe and **51% usable** under
8-shard fleet load. So the costume works but degrades with concurrency or volume. That is the next
thing to characterise, and the obvious experiments are:

1. Does usable% fall with **concurrency** (workers/shard) or with **cumulative requests** (a quota)?
   Run one shard at 2, 8, 15 workers and compare. This is a 20-minute experiment and it decides
   whether the answer is pacing or rotation.
2. Do **different costumes degrade differently**? `pool_health.py`-style sweep but under load, not
   single requests. `firefox133` and `edge101` were also 2/2 clean and are untested at scale.
3. Is degradation **per exit IP**? `blocks.Tally.by_exit()` already attributes outcomes to individual
   IPs — surface it in the run record and look for a burned subset rather than a uniform decline.

---

## 2. What got built today, and why each piece exists

Every one of these came from a specific failure. The failures matter more than the code.

| module | catches | born from |
|---|---|---|
| `blocks.py` | why a fetch failed — 11 classes, per-method AND per-exit-IP | one `unreachable` counter covered 4 causes; four models were fitted to it and three were wrong |
| `ladder.py` | a closed access method — rotates costume, then escalates rung, persists the choice | the system correctly detected a closed path and had no reflex to try another |
| `sessions.py` | identity lifecycle — session budget learned from real burns | collapse tracked request COUNT not time; ~50 requests per primed cookie |
| `pace.py` | request rate — AIMD, trip threshold derived from observed background | every fixed rate constant was wrong within a day |
| `extract_qa.py` | a parser that stopped extracting — field fill vs trailing baseline | a 200 that is wrong is worse than a 403, and nothing watched for it |
| `value_rules.py` | plausible-but-wrong values — UPC check digit, ABV range, price sanity, cross-field | right type + wrong number survives every other check |
| `raw_capture.py` | full payloads, append-only | payloads inside an accumulating catalog made memory scale with the TABLE |
| `pool_health.py` | what every proxy exit actually is (geo, ISP, reachability) + live-fire per exit | production ran on an unaccounted pool; 26 of 50 exits were non-US |

### The design rules these share

- **Escalate/act on CLASSIFIED blocks only.** `not_found` and `timeout` must never move a rate, a
  session budget, or a rung. Treating a dead-store background as pushback is how a healthy run
  throttles itself to a standstill — that happened, twice.
- **Learn constants, don't pick them.** Five constants were wrong within a day. Anything describing a
  system we don't control (rate limits, quotas, block thresholds) must be derived from observation —
  *and* capped, because calibrating during an outage teaches the controller that being blocked is
  normal (that happened too).
- **Never let bookkeeping outrank evidence.** Coverage is derived from landed data, not from a
  self-calibrating watermark.
- **Cheapest move first.** A TLS costume change costs one string; a browser costs 10–50× throughput and
  a Chromium per process. The ladder exhausts costumes before escalating.
- **Never auto-escalate into spend.** The ladder stops at the last free rung unless `FETCH_POLICY`
  explicitly allows more.

---

## 3. The failure pattern to watch for

Nearly every bug this session was **a system reporting itself healthy while doing nothing useful**:

- a wrecked run graded itself **100% complete** against a watermark set by its own previous wreck
- a throttled 200 counted as coverage — **242,503 stores "covered", 10,040 with data**
- a hung fleet kept its last metrics and read as alive (**8 shards, 0 progress, 4 minutes**)
- a pacer **climbed** while 82% of responses were CAPTCHAs
- three tests asserted one layer away from where the bug lived, and passed while the feature did nothing

**If a number looks good, check what would have to be true for it to be false.** The instrumentation
lying was consistently more expensive than the scrapers breaking.

## 4. The costume finding (the day's actual answer)

Measured on the live target, same IPs, same rate, same minute:

```
chrome / chrome124 / chrome131             BLOCKED
safari17_0 / safari18_0 / safari17_2_ios   OK
firefox133 / edge101 / chrome99_android    OK
```

UberEats fingerprints the **desktop-Chrome TLS family specifically**. We had been sending
`impersonate="chrome"`. A day went into modelling rate limits, session quotas, IP reputation and
geography for what was one string — **and the precedent was already in our own notes** (DoorDash:
"safari17_0 beats Forter, Chrome 403s").

**Lesson for next time: sweep the cheap identity variables FIRST.** TLS profile, UA, headers. Ten
minutes, before any modelling.

---

## 5. Decisions banked (don't re-litigate)

- **Do NOT buy more proxies.** 200 requests through 50 fresh, correctly-geolocated US residential IPs
  returned **zero** successes while the cold path was blocked. Addresses were never the problem.
  The $178/month 1000-IP plan would have bought nothing.
- **The IPRoyal subscription (15 Canadian ISP proxies, order #77366284) is unused** — zero traffic
  since 2026-07-26, not referenced by production. Cancel or repurpose.
- Production runs on a **Webshare** pool in the `ISP_PROXIES` Fly secret (50 entries, 49 US + 1 CA).
  Set it with `flyctl secrets set ISP_PROXIES="$(tr '\n' ',' < proxies.txt | sed 's/,$//')"`.
  Note: ~45KB is near Fly's secret limit, so a 1000-IP pool needs Tigris-backed loading instead.

---

## 6. Operating it

```bash
# deploy — NEVER `flyctl deploy` directly (it ships your working tree, not main)
python3 tools/release_train.py deploy

# every test (the curated list in run_tests.sh is NOT all of them)
for t in unifyd/*_test.py; do python3 "$t"; done

# what every proxy exit really is
flyctl ssh console -a hoodie-suite -C "python3 /app/unifyd/pool_health.py"

# fire real requests per exit — burned vs fresh identity comparison
flyctl ssh console -a hoodie-suite -C "python3 /app/unifyd/pool_health.py --fire 4"

# rebuild coverage from landed evidence after a bad run
flyctl ssh console -a hoodie-suite -C "python3 -c \"
import sys; sys.path.insert(0,'/app/unifyd'); import ue_catalog as U; U.repair_checkpoints('ubereats')\""
```

**After any deploy touching `source_registry.py`, re-pin the dispatcher** (`tools/repin_dispatcher.sh`)
— the release train does this automatically, a manual deploy does not.

---

## 7. What I'd do next, in order

1. **Characterise the 51% degradation** (§1). Concurrency vs cumulative — 20 minutes, decides everything.
2. **Surface `by_exit()` in the run record.** The attribution exists but isn't reported; a burned subset
   looks identical to a uniform decline without it.
3. **Prove `ue_enrich` end-to-end.** It has never completed a run — it died on a schema bug every time,
   so everything past its first query is unexercised. UPC backfill is unproven.
4. **`pool_health` on a schedule.** A pool silently drifting to 52% foreign looked exactly like "the
   target got harder". That should page, not wait for someone to check.
5. **Then** revisit the 3-hour target. The arithmetic works; the costume stability is the blocker.

---

## 8. Known-unresolved

- The **browser rung works** (3/3 real catalogs) but is unproven at volume and is 10–50× slower.
  It's a fallback, not a bulk path.
- **`ue_catalog._ck_save` re-serializes the entire done-set every batch** — ~123 MB per shard per pass,
  O(n²) in universe size. Wasteful, not incorrect. Delta checkpoints are the fix.
- **16+ test files exist that the curated runner never ran.** They pass now, but the runner's list is
  hand-maintained and will drift again; it prints unlisted files as a warning.
